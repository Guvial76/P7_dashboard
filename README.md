# P7_dashboard
 
This project folder is designed to roll out an interactive dashboard of credit decisions.

It consists of the following files:
* modelisation.ipynb: modelisation notebook
* trained_model.joblib: serialized classification model
* trained_model_threshold.joblib: serialized model's threshold
* dashboard.py: interactive dashboard program
* note_m√©thodo.pdf: selected methodology description (in French)
* requirement.txt: development environment description


The .csv files with the processed train and test data have not been uploaded for size limitation reasons.  
However, they can be rendered by the execution of the notebook on the input data. 
The latter can be found under : https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data
